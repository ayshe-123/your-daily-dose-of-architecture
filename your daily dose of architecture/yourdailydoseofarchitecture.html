  <h2>WHAT IS CUBISM AND WHERE DID IT CAME FROM?</h2>
  <p>
      Cubism, highly influential visual arts style of the 20th century that was created principally by
    the artists Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in Paris between 1907 and 1914.

  <p>
       Cubism was one of the most influential styles of the twentieth century. It is generally agreed to
    have begun around 1907 with Picasso’s celebrated painting Demoiselles D’Avignon which included elements
    of cubist style. The name ‘cubism’ seems to have derived from a comment made by the critic Louis Vauxcelles 
    who, on seeing some of Georges Braque’s paintings exhibited in Paris in 1908, described them as reducing 
    everything to ‘geometric outlines, to cubes’.
